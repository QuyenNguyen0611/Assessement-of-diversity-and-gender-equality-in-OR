# Assessment-of-diversity-and-gender-equality-in-OR
This is my master's project.
There are two main purposes of this project
The first purpose is to analyze geographical diversity in OR, I used VOSviewer software to identify countries/regions of publications in OR
The second purpose is to utilize machine learning and deep learning to classify gender based on first names. 
Besides, this project built my abilities on data visualization and statistical analysis.
